This repository contains the manuscript and code for paper "Unnecessary Bias."

This is all tentative, but here's the abstract:

> Following \cite{KingTomzWittenberg2000}, researchers commonly convert coefficient estimates into an estimate of the quantity of interest using the average of simulations. However, other researchers follow the advice of \cite{King1989} and use the invariance property of maximum likelihood estimates to quickly convert the coefficients into the quantity of interest. These approaches are not equivalent, yet researchers seem to give little thought to the choice. I show that the average of simulations can introduce substantial bias compared to the maximum likelihood estimate. In general, when reporting point estimates of the quantity of interest, researchers should report the maximum likelihood estimate, not the average of the simulations.
